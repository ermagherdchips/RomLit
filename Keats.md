# Keats: Narrative Poems, Artists and Illustrators
* EXAM: all texts and topics on the original reading list will still be examined on

## Negative capability and the ode
* His odes are viewed as his crowning glory: his trademark 'negative capability' (coined himself early on in his writing in a letter (1817) - promise and possibilities created by being in a state of uncertainty and doubt, turning a negative into a positive
* Indeterminacy of language set in a determined structure - Ode to Autumn's language is determined by structure 

## Endymion (1818)
* Written to prove himself as a poet - the epic is seen as a literary rite of passage in this period (WW's Excursion while Keats is writing, Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and Don Juan) - Q1
* Characterised by Keatsean excess - sequence of sensual indulgence and aesthetic ruminations 
* Learning to be a poet
* Met with outrage and described as the 'gross slang of voluctuousness' by a critic
* Control, excess, restraint (or a lack of) is considered throughout his career, and vulgarities of class connotations from his lower-middle-class background
* Q2 - balancing between imagination and judgement happens in Isabella, Eve of St Agnes, the whole point of Lamia
* Imagination, judgement, and restraint is complex in the narrative poems - evolves from one poem to the next

## Density of description
* Sensual evocativeness in the narrative poems that is only partly or problematically satisfied - an ache between pleasure and pain (ambiguity between these for Keats - pleasure never comes without pain)
* Poetic ruminations on human sympathy and the limitations on human sympathy - closely associated with his proclamation in Q3
* After his death, his poetry endures an obscurity, circulated in pirated editions, and only 1848 onwards that he garners any form of interest - Victorian period values his poetry for its pictorial qualities
* Victorian artists: pre-Raphaelites feel they have 'discovered' Keats 
* He is considered to be a visual poet, or a painter-poet, within his work
* Depictions of romance are accompanied by violence - seduction on the level of characters and on a textual level
* Keats' language becomes another form of seduction
* Countering an inherited view that Keats is a disinterested and uninvested poet 
* Sense of 'multiple Keats' - the Keats of aesthetics that we have inherited, but also the politically motivated Keats who successfully became an apothecary (medical Keats) 

## Isabella
* Q5 - malady, lovesickness that neither can express their desires; love associated with anguish and inarticulacy, depicted as claustrophobic
* Inward vision of the lovers - covertous and sly vision 
* P1 creates a domestic politics, contrasting with the brothers - unaware of their imminent danger, same in the poem, echoing an ambivalence about the lovers in the poem; vulnerability may or may not evoke our sympathy
* Q6 - ironic detachment - exasperation with the lovers, conveying a more general ambivalence over the genre of romance 
* Q7 - repetition has a sense of him grappling with the subject matter, adding a reworking of another story to the catalogue; self-reflective criticism and frustation with the very genre he has chosen to write in 
* Everest on 'Isabella and the Marketplace' - interested in selling his wares and this permeates the poem
* Q9: Simulatenously drawn to a new area of endeavour and exploitation - sympathising with the workers and the toil of the servants, which is accompanied by and at odds with experimentations with poetic sensation - lack of humanity produces keen and vivid imagery; sensuous images of pain evoke images of perverse pleasure, a bewildering spectacle; repetition of 'ore' shows that Keats equates the exploitation of lanauge for poetry but also with the brothers' assets - the literal wealth of the masters is met with the metaphoric wealth of poetry
* Keats' verse is infused with economic and political discourses, anxieties over class and literary aspirations - Nicolas Roe writes on this most - always in financial circumstances which are not optimal, all money held in legal cases (becomes the basis of the case in Bleak House) - interest in money
* Keatsean wealth, density of details - visual consumption and consumerism 
* Isabella sees Lorenzo's head as a 'precious jewel' - profusion of growth in the Pot of Basil - profit comes from loss, tale of grief is poetically productive
* Keats constructs a relationship in which the Basil thrives as Isabella diminishes, feeds from her tears; Isabella's wasting body is also being unnaturally stimulated - surfaced desires in the poem
* Through his narrator, he reminds us that this circumstance is a 'horrid thing' - epitomising the grotesque as the beauty revolts


## Eve of St Agnes (1819), revised later
* Revised when writing To Autumn
* Contains what were thought of as 'jewels of description' 
* The literal and figurative climax of the poem is revised to make it clear it is an act of sexual congress because he does not want it to be ambivalent - Q10
    * Inward fragrance of the lovers' heart - the hero's literal excitement drives us towards the climax of the poem and its after-effects
    * Graphic depiction of the desire of the male
* Q11 has a sense of crystallising the cusp of something on the epitome of sensuality 
* Highly sensuous, but also disturbing in that she is depicted as a saint 'free from mortal taint' but the intention is mortal
* Q12: erotic scene of seduction is problematised - warm (invited to extend our sympathies to her, not straightforwardly objectified); mermaid is a curious depiction concerned with texture that is repellent within a description of something sexually evocative; half-hidden and something left to the imagination and not fully exposed; not always participating in his view, with a slight detachment between the narrator and the character - complex scene
* Q13: Disoriented by a note of excess, struck by the strain on the limits of language (repetition of heap and heaped)
* Q14: Byron objects to what he sees as a Keatsean 'sex in the head' - raising the 'pleasure themometer' - trying to prolong and extend sensory expeirences in a cumulative process that sustains pleasure hand-in-hand with the narartive energy and drive of the poem, ebcause of sensation; but even Keats can only maintain this fevered state for so long
* Q15: Stillinger talks about how the seduction of the tale is because of the old romance of the tale - she is hoodwinked by the fancy of the narrative - overlooks her painful change where reality intrudes upon fantasy - using the half-line to impinge and build up a consciousness; spectrum plunges us back to fantasy 
* Phantoms - in a single line, they become distanced 

## Conclusions
* Typify the romances, but conflicted about it - revisioning these ideas (literally with re-writing the poems)
* Troublesome yet enthralling images - sensation and sympathy, fantasy and reality, limits of language, sickness and death - at the end of Eve of St Agnes, the one thing we are left with are the Baron's nightmares, his dream of mortality 
* The stories and legends themselves persist 
* Q16:
