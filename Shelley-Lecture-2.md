Lecture will be put on DUO

* Poet of emotional extremes: desire, our longing for change
    * Poet of colliding ideas and impulses
    * He involves us in the drama of his poems
* Ode to the West Wind (1819)
    * 'new birth' may relate to Mary's pregnancy
    * 'Let us believe in a kind of optimism in which we are our own Gods' - the wind is a secular equivalent to the spirit
    * Wrestling - takes us back to 'Hymn for Intellectual Beauty' used in a more secular humanist way
    * Heightened power of expression - Wordsworth says he was the 'best artist of us all'
    * Poetic form used by Dante and used later for a visionary narrative
    * Exploiting how it can be used to see forwards - final couplets as resolutions
    * Fusing feelings - compares and contrasts the wind - calls an omnipresent holy spirit and recollections of hindu gods
    * Desire to write transformative political poetry 
    * Second section - sacrifice required by the poet
    * Fourth section - only here he enters the poem (prior it is third poem)
    * Q24: moment of premature despair - not aware of this until we get to that line - moves towards a collapse then reasserts his poetic personality in the couplet
