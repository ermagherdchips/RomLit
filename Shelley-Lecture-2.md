Lecture will be put on DUO

* Poet of emotional extremes: desire, our longing for change
    * Poet of colliding ideas and impulses
    * He involves us in the drama of his poems
* Ode to the West Wind (1819)
    * 'new birth' may relate to Mary's pregnancy
    * 'Let us believe in a kind of optimism in which we are our own Gods' - the wind is a secular equivalent to the spirit
    * Wrestling - takes us back to 'Hymn for Intellectual Beauty' used in a more secular humanist way
    * Heightened power of expression - Wordsworth says he was the 'best artist of us all'
    * Poetic form used by Dante and used later for a visionary narrative
    * Exploiting how it can be used to see forwards - final couplets as resolutions
    * Fusing feelings - compares and contrasts the wind - calls an omnipresent holy spirit and recollections of hindu gods
    * Desire to write transformative political poetry 
    * Second section - sacrifice required by the poet
    * Fourth section - only here he enters the poem (prior it is third poem)
    * Q24: moment of premature despair - not aware of this until we get to that line - moves towards a collapse then reasserts his poetic personality in the couplet
    * Admitting that a union with another can never quite happen - imperatives change to command and drive
    * Draws attention to the fact that he is in charge - in the final section, the 'incantation of this verse' and the poet in all his force is powerful
    * 'scatter' - wants his words to be scattered among mankind, backing off from controlling the reader 
    * Shellian negative - 'as from an unextinguished hearth'
    * 'trumpet of a prophecy' - Shelley makes the wind his instrument, and he is the trumpeteer
    * Finished the poem as a statement, but last minute he finishes with a question (similar to what he does in Mont Blanc) - Shelley is making us aware of the difference between the literal meaning and the metaphorical meanings
    * We have to embrace an optimism that depends on hope - cannot guarantee anything, possibility of the individuals and passes the baton of intrpretation to the reader
    * Q1 can be linked: subtle poet aware of the complexities of writing radical poetry
* Prometheus Unbound
    * Lyrical drama, central poem in the collection
    * Fight between Prometheus and Jupiter that was to be resolved, describes himself as hostile to the outcome and writes his own sequel
    * Wants the champion to defeat the oppressor of mankind: poem is seeing how to do this
    * Link to Paradise Lost - Prometheus's Satan is the Hero
    * Shelley calls out the message to his precursors but not following in their footsteps
    * Act One as a part of struggle - awaits the struggle of a changed universe
    * Disenchanted as in free from enchantment - Q4
    * Radical looking at the world outside - not just about his own time and speaks to other historical periods
    * Q5: despairing lines then sneaks in optimism through 'want' (means both lack and desire) - want and need
    * Renunciation of hatred - aware of how slow a process this is 
    * Romantics liked a curse - similar to Byron - hence why Prometheus wants to hear the words again - Jupiter obligingly repeating against himself the things that Prometheus said 
    * Hatred, even if virtuous hatred, can degenerate into a kind of dance with the hated person - very interested in hatred and how it binds you to the person you hate
    * Shelley believes that Jesus' words encourage religious wars - but loved the Bible - heterodox religion because it embbodies culture's desire for something better 
    * Section 1 ends with some positivity - Q6 - is this how Shelley writes compared to the likes of Keats?
    * Seeing the possibilities of something more in Act 2: Q7: Asia is Prometheus' female counterpart
    * Q2 drawing his operations from those of the human mind - comparing a concrete state to an abstract state - poem internalising itself
    * Q8 shows his fascination in not knowing why social change happens - Demagorgon as an X in the poem, when we act we think it is because of our own agency, but those who look on see there is a force and 'spirit of age'
    * Q11 - rhyming of soul and control
    * Final stanza (Q12) brings Demagorgon on, and then states the words of the mantras needed - infinitives imply their permanent relevance to the human condition
* Adonais
    * Stuart Curran says that the way to understand Adonais is that marble is transformed to flame - starts off chilled and artificial, invoking different mythologies, but then stagnates and cannot get going
    * Sense of the non-ongoing ness
    * Q13: Keats' early death 
    * Stanza 21 as the centre of the poem - losing all the resources
    * Reversal - decides that we all die and Keats is living - Kkeats' spirit is imperishabel and his poetry lives
    * 39: moves towards an idea that death is life and life is death
    * Moves from a calm philosophical proposition to a more dark one
    * Scream of intense rage
    * Not invoking inspiration, but *claims* it
* Like Adonais in that it's full of questions, but doesn't offer the answers this poem gives us
* Rousseau as an important figure to Shelley
* Allows interpretation and provisionality of experience
