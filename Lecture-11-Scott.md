# Walter Scott's *Waverley*
* New entrance to Scotland and its cultures through 'Edinburgh Waverley'
* Scott is both highly complex intellectually aesthetically and politically
* Reading Scott well means being open to diverse themes that interest him - broad writer, learned writer
    * National history and identity
    * Politics of his time and our own: Scottish independence/devolution 
    * Books, buildings, stories, ballads: collected, translations of German/European literature 
* Qualities as a writer - least discussed aspect of his work, but how he won over his audiences
* Shares qualities with other Romantic works
    * Revolutionary novel; Jacobite revolution, national civil unrest and protest/wars - ubiqitous writer 
    * Imagination: more complex than in poets because Scott does not just set out individual imagination, but an imagination of readers and national audiences
    * Significance of reading - common with characters in *Persuasion* (what they read and how they interpret through what they read)

## Walter Scott
* First major historical novelist - invention of historical fiction as a dominant mode in 19th century
* Predominantly a poet
* Despite his own socially conservative positions, his novels are packed full of marginal characters left out of previous fictions
    * Not just servants/sidekicks, but important characters within the fictions
    * Dissident voices, marginalised for reasons of class/gender/occupation
    * These previously marginal characters have their own perspectives and values - shape future fiction (e.g. Scott is a key figure for Thomas Hardy)

## Waverley: summary
* Published 1814 anonymously - undercover identity as 'the author of Waverley', identity revealed in 1827 due to bankruptcy
    * Guessing as a key part of the novel
    * No context/expectations when published - no genre suggested for itself, no past history etc. - unmarked field
* Main character is mustering for rebellion; caught between two different family politics
* Fighting against his own cause as a Jacobite
* Far from the worlds of Austen/Radcliffe and the 18th c. novelists (Richardson/Fielding) - the matter of history is important in a way that is different to what existed before

## Context
* Prose fiction is experimental and revolutionary - subtitle just says we are being taken into the past
* Other authors withholding themselves - Austen's 'a novel by a lady'; Radcliffe's 'a romance interspersed with poetry'
* Sense of genre and where it fits, sometimes gender
* Aware of themselves and where they fit in the relatively new form of the novel

## Quote 1: Hazlitt
* Hazlitt encapsulating Scott in *The Spirit of the Age* (1825)
* 'He is only the amanuensis of truth and history.' - common approach to Scott, only copying down what is already there, not a creator/inventor
* Critics often give this impression of Scott - so close to nature his creative skills are lacking
* The opposite is the case, but it looks as if he is only giving truth and history

## Complexity of his writing
* Chapter 1 - spends a lot of time in the opening chapter showing what kind of novel his isn't going to be
* Quote 2 - ties in with WW's ideas on the Lyrical Ballads in the Preface 
    * Highly self-conscious chapter - careful self-positioning as a writer, history of fashions of writing
    * Genre matters - positioning himself and his writers
* Chapter 5 (quote 3) - self-conscious, asking for patience from his readers as he sets up the narrative
    * Setting up a parallel between the reader's journey in the novel and the hero's excursion from a life further away from familiar manners
    * Typical of romance novels - moving away from central culture to the outlines and then coming back with new perspective
    * This is more self-conscious in Scott - Waverley is a representative of the reader, as a reader himself, stages of Scottish society through the perspective of someone like ourselves

## Political views/context
* Conflicted political views and the subject of this novel (Jacobite rebellion)
* Romance of the Jacobite alternative is powerful for him
* Letter to a friend: glad to not live in the era - conflicted emotions and loyalties to the leader
* These conflicts are shared by Edward - he falls in love with Flora, and then with the grace/charm of Charles
* Emotional shift, not a political one - readers also undergo an emotional transformation and intensity too

## Revival of 'Romance'
* Haunts Romanticism - the term often used in the period and in the extracts from Hazlitt/Scott
* Important combining element in Romantic period writings (Christabel, Eve of St Agnes, Hemans)
* Revival of Romance and the significance of revolution come together historically in the close of the 18th century
* Radcliffe announces her novels as a romance, Keats experiments with forms of 'Romance' and uses the term, WW in the Prelude (bk5) considers writing a romance of King Arthur
* Revaluation of romance is important and significance
* Scholarly and textual appreciation of older works, primarily *The Fairie Queene* (1760s letters, gothic)
* Made possible by the uncovering of Romance texts - no longer in private collections, but available in public libraries
* More than narrowly textual - crucial in the political debates of the 1790s (Burke's 'Age of Chivalry is gone')
    * For conservative critics, Romance is a way of mourning the passing of a system of aristocratic absolutism
    * For others, romance represents political as well as imaginative freedom - golden age of equality and fellowship
    * Used in different ways by political writers

## Romantic Scotland in *Waverley*
* Quote 4: more glamorous Scottish life - conscious of the strange parallels between his own imaginations and what seems to be reality
* Emphasis on his own fantasies and daydreams becoming reality 
* Appropriation by the Jacobite cause is more pragmatic (needs his family connections): Waverley is seduced into the Jacobite cause in self-conscious Scottish glamour
* Emotional rather than intellectual/political conversion is held out to the reader
* Quote 5: interweaves Scottish culture and instructing in the way of life
    * Translation of phrases, and what 'tail on' means
    * Comic moment, but part of a series of educative manoeuvres which take place in the novel
* Quote 6: reinforces the idea that the Romantic Scotland promoted by Scott is the creation of Fergus and Flora for political ends
    * Motif of dream, imagination, and fantasy

## Heroism
* Scott's hero is a new type of anxiously demasculinised hero in fiction - imaginative, passive, feminised, bookish, not an active questing hero, confused
* Quote 7: Flora pinpoints his character in a patronising way, but identifies the kind of hero he is
    * Finishing the chapter with this unspoken reflection 
    * Not a man of action, but an artist, decorator, aesthetically driven person rather than socially/politically active
    * Not unlike the kind of reader that this novel appeals to

## Historical/factual tones 
* Quote 8: How Scott inserts historical information into his narrative in a courteous way
    * Practical wordings
* In the novel, the rebellion does not succeed, the battle happens off-stage (critics thinks Scott shies away from the battle)
    * Difficult revolutionary moment - getting readers to appreciate complexities without turning them away from it

## Ending
* Historical ending Scott has to write (and is done powerfully) of the Jacobite executions
    * Waverley's friend represents what happened to aristocrats who rebelled, Fergus tried/executed
* After this, he is plucked from history and restored - extended fantasy of reconciliation 
    * Strong fantasy recuperative element of what happens to Waverley
* Given the fiction and the reality in the endings 
* Revolutionary time - balancing the dangers of investing the readers emotionally in a Jacobite past 

## Scottish culture
* Throughout the novel, Scott imagines the readers are English
* Finding out about Scottish culture and seeing it from the outside, comic buildup 
* In the trials scene, an English courtroom/audience watches Fergus give testimony, and his brother intervenes (Quote 11)
    * Interest in the language/cultural difference of Maccombich
    * The English court changes sides in the speech - while we do not change sides as readers, we become emotionally on side
    * A culture which seems alien and distant at the start of the novel is the one we become on the side of - emotional complexity
* Cultural transformation and preparing the cultural conditions for this 
* Quote 12 shows how consciously Scott does this
    * Self-conscious signalling by Scott on the importance of art in creating a fantasy of the past that is recuperating for the present
    * The painting is a complete fiction and fantasy of the friendship and uprising - most of the novel has them quarreling
    * The novel itself as a spirited painting of the past - mingling of history and romance
* Scott is critical of the excesses of Waverley's imagination, showing him as ill-judging and misled, but not denouncing the imagination itself as it is this that creates social coherence - collective imagination of the readership of this novel
* Published in 1814: when the 100 Days break out - the restoration of the legitimate line is charged in terms of its own historical moment
