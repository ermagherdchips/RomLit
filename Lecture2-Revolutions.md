# Revolutionary Contexts: Independence and Liberty
## Revolutionary contexts
* The Romantic period was full of contradiction, paradox, and conflict
* Care about social progress alongside individuality and introspection
* Revolutions in thought, styles of thinking, styles of feeling and expressing feeling, and in writing
* Term 'revolution' was shifting in itself: concerned with a sense of return to an earlier state, but also with a sudden break and overthrow of government
* French and American revolutionary contexts
* Revolution is concerned with independence and liberty, concerned with freedom and fraternity 

## American and French Revolution
* The independence revolution in America was a cultural shock and prompted a rethinking of Britain's position in the world - reinforced Britain's developing sense of self as a historical country, an old power rather than a new power that was redefining and resisting classical traditions
* Independence challenged intellectual, social, and moral authorities in the declaration of independence 
* Hazlitt's Spirit of the Age highlights a sense of a separate entity in Britain as the result of revolutions that have occurred
