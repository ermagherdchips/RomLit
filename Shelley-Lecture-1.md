# Shelley, *Alastor*, 'Hymn to Intellectual Beauty', and *Mont Blanc*
### Introduction
* Alastor (1815), other two (1816)
* Alastor as a quest romance - quests and questioning
* Acts as an internalised spiritual allegory when presenting us with a romance quest - journeyings of the central poet figure is not just physical, but through time, history, mythology etc., and into the psyche, seeking out a truth/ideal
* Questions - he is a sceptical idealist, someone who desparately wants to believe in beauty and sublimity, but at the same time finds him holding those beliefs to account and wants to question them
* Heterodox poet
* Allegory and an idealisation of autobiographical elements of his own life - pattern of the quest 
    * Has a vision, seeks it, fails to find it - this is the questline
* Tangible moment of vision, losing it, and finding the rest of their quest tragically seeking out something that is irrevocably lost

### Alastor
* Published in 1816, title poem of the collection
* 'offers allegorical account of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind' (Preface)
* Preoccupied with the quest of the human mind and heart, affirming its belief in the otherworldly/sublime: at the same time, he is sceptical of these things
* Deeply steeped in Coleridge
* Disappointment that his beliefs are not fulfiled in the poem 
* Q1: links to Wordsworth - abandoned and uncertain in an un-Wordsworthian way
    * Talks of a holy trinity similar to Wordsworth
    * No revelation or ability of the Wordsworthian imagination of these forces coming together to see into the life of things
    * Darker realisation of the incommunicable dream
    * Interconnectedness between human and nature most drastic conclusion 
* Q2: Ending lines as a frame for the quest which takes place
    * Loss experienced by both the narrator poet and the poet figure
    * Searching for an embodiment of the ideal - leaves his alienated home on a quest for an ideal
    * Self-projection of his own desires
    * Death and demise of the poet figure 
    * Material embodiment of the ideal he believes he has lost
    * Critics respond to this as a condemnation of Wordsworthian aesthetic/poetic - what his poet figure shows is the outcome of the Wordsworthian creator gone too far
    * Tintern Abbey 'never betrayed the heart but loved her', but this ambivalence and darker possibility of this explored in Shelley
* Projection of the poet figure's own psyche: narcissistic quest?
* Similar account of the poet narrator of his own failed quest to find evidence for his belief in his ideal form of nature as the great parent and the failed quest of the parent figure - mirroring each other 
* Is the poet figure's quest a mirror of the poet narrator's psyche? - some people argue they are separate

### Hymn to Intellectual Beauty
* Developing plot line and quest of the ideal 
* Intellectual Beauty suggests the Miltonic, the transcendental sublime, of an unorthodox nature
* Hymn: even if heterodox, it is a poetic conventional form to offer praise
* Both wanting to hold out for belief in the distance of this power, but still doubting its existence
* Q3 as the beginning: piling up of similes 
    * Enigmatic power - allows human consciousness to perceive its effects in the world
    * Partial representations that attempt to signpost what the nature of the spirit might be like - always present and absent simultaneously
    * Scepticism working the fabric of his language - not sure what he can truly avow
    * Evoking Christian phrases but always subject to a scepticism
* Q4: idea we should give up on believing in the presence of a divine power
    * Heterodoxy coming through: more conventional modes he learnt as a child rejected
    * Whether they be an unorthodox cast or not, he looks into whether we can believe in the power of presence because the only basis we have is the process of our own imaginings as fictions that we have invented
    * Alert to the power of the imagination to imagine things; sense that imaginings offer a concrete sense of our experience, being, and the world around us, even if they are treated with some scepticism
* Q5: cultivates in a famous image
    * Beauty but also risk of becoming enslaving - scepticism may harden into a dogma that he is sceptical of
    * Despite the possibility of revelation and illumination, they point out a darker sense of vacancy (of meaning/purpose) beyond language itself
    * Certain moments in the hymn consider the loveliness of Beauty but limited to language
    * Shelley reflects back on similies - aware that he tests/stretches language to capture the absent shadow that might exist but might not

### Mont Blanc
* Similarly to Alastor, he deliberately invokes Coleridge's presence as a poet here
* Mont Blanc as its title is directly placing Shelley in response to Coleridge's *Hymn to Sunrise* (1802)
    * Coleridge's approach to the mountain and language is creatively invented
    * Coleridge saw in it an unquestionable proof of the existence of the divine
* Shelley is more sceptical
* Five sections, irregularly rhymed but does rhyme; modelling off Milton's Lycidas
* Q11: treating Wordsworth's view with scepticism
    * Strong impression of the scene around the speaker - so much of the scene is absent however
    * Things that are present, but also point to their absence (e.g. 'moonless') - links to Hymn
* Rhyme/preoccupation of rhyme - starts with everlasting things
* Concern of how the mind relates to the experiential world - inner/outer and mind/mountain become indistinguishable
* Wants to give the power a transcendent place - beyond human perception

### Epipsychidion
* Occasioned by Shelley feeling deeply invested in the plight of a countess
* Similar to the quest narratives of Alastor - poet figure who experiences a true vision that combines the material and spiritual, mind and matter
* Q6: allegorising aspect, transformed to have a divine presence
    * Coalescence of body and spiritual embodiment
* Increasingly self-conscious about its own workings and how it uses language
* Q13: Shellian dramatic pose - poet comes crashing down
* After the fall from imaginative heights, there is an idyllic idea
* Paradise in the future - Eden lost behind us in the past
* Casting a possible utopian future as an ideal that has already been wrecked somewhere behind us

### Concluding remarks
* Shelley's poetic remarks are infinite - utopian ideals, possible ideals, stretching beynd the contingencies of their existence
* Desire for the transcendent/sublime power is always one that is constrained by an awareness that these are fictions, rooted in imaginative visions of love and life and holding out that poetry might mean something but do not
* No good elegising the poet whilst not elegising his past existence
* Deep recognistion in Alastor of a commitment to wanting to press at its fictions
