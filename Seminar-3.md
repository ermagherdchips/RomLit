# Social criticism
* Formative as a timed/full essay, deadline as start of next term - **optional**
* Next tutorial - Hazlitt general topic
* Key to the issue of gender is cosnidering how it was represented in past work, who has access to these things based on levels of education, how women are enclosed by fiction

## Wollstonecraft
* Themes of gender, rights
* Importance of education
* Cross-class gender struggles - confinement after pregnacy going mad (theme of oppression)
* Despite now being considered a feminist icon, she was an issue for women writers following her because of her husband's memoir of his wife - goes against the acceptable grain of its time by acknowledging her illegitimate daughter and giving reviewers ammunition
### The Wrongs of Woman, or Maria
* Rights of her own treatise and the novel - in dialogue with one another
* Jemima is the kind of complication that enters into a fictitious narrative kept out of the Vindication - general theory of women's role in society, when coming to novelise it, it is complex
* Critics of Maria see Jemima as a problematic character who is not quite right 
* Class dialogue alongside Wordsworth's LBs: narrator talking to a child or someone from a different class - passages in Romantic Literature summarising class dialogues
* Jemima as a servant but an ambiguous figure - not controlled by Maria, considered a prison-worker
* Feminist icons like Virginia Woolf were not intersectional with class/race - issues
* Economic and social pragmatism, and the novelist's desire to show us an alternative
* Women warned against overbelief of the stories in books, yet Wollstonecraft herself writes the book - layers of possible irony
* Linking strongly in Bronte's Wildfell Hall - problem in this novel with men appropriating women's narratives; who has control of writing?
* Linking to Eliot's 'Silly Lady Novelists'
* Blake's Mind-forged manacles - oppression not from outside, but internalised - Maria is the victim and internalises this structure and thus expects from men this authority
    * Garden of Love links - physical restrictions on something abstract
    * Internalised structures are suggested through physical objects, gothic themes - these constraints are imagined through landscape
    * Image of the manacles itself - physical representation of the psychological
### The Vindication of the Rights of Woman
* Wollstonecraft does not write about class but writes a lot about education in *The Vindication* 
* Uncomfortable to modern feminists - women to be educated to be better mothers
* Not that education is just for her
* Lots written about women reading novels, against the heroine that novels promote 
* Rousseau in her sights - criticises him in a way that prevents her having to criticise the women writers promoting the sickly feeble woman in delicate sensibility idea - sharp about the effects of fiction

## Austen 
### Pride and Prejudice
* Link to Vindication of Women - Mrs Bennett is not the iconic woman, but she is not disparaging - like a letting agent
* Dichtomy of being a bad mother as she is not sentimental, but the social dimension cannot fully be written off
* Reconciled in the end, but there is an obvious prevalence that the two threads do not interwine
* Complication of the fictitious - we read these novels to be convinced that stories like Elizabeth Bennett's is possible
* Sympathy with her position - does need to get the girls married off, but she is perhaps a bad stockbroker as she doesn't sell them very well 
* Understandable instincts not put well into practice
* Negative image of the reading woman (Mary) - her access to books is an over-focus on education
* Emphasis of artistic images
* Male narrative in his letter - authority is reasserted through his telling of the story - compare to other letters in Austen
    * Wentworth's letter in *Persuasion* - information and misinformation going back and forth
* Elizabeth does a lot of reading but it is not dealt with much by Austen - not considered as part of her sensibility?
* Books matter much in Darcy's library - guarantor and stamp of culture
    * Added to - alert to present day writing 
    * Static aristocratic figure to be transformed by Elizabeth, but more progressive than seems at first
### Other Austen
* Sense and Sensibility - kinds and styles of reading are important
* Considering adaptations - representing dialogue so well
* Persuasion - not necessarily her final polished work, oddities in it, but the only novel which we have an alternative chapter for
    * Best clues about her composition as opposed to the style 
    * Less punctuation, precision and authority on the page through punctuation
    * Trying out ideas on the page and rejecting
* Volume structure of Persuasion - fairytale reversal and tweak in the middle of the novel, facilitated by Louisa Musgrave's fall
    * Not a fallen woman but has symbolic quality - jumps expecting to be caught; physical moment but interesting in its wider symbolic implications
    * Everything happens bceause of the autonomous evidence of Mrs Smith - not how her endings are normally done, usually not having a magical bringing of evidence
* Austen's social criticism is moderate - reform from the inside rather than Wollstonecraft's destroy and rebuild


Social criticism including a literary criticism in itself
Letters and who writes them and their status within texts - linking Wollstonecraft with Austen in a technical way
How does one criticise society in a fictional structure which reinforces stereotypes? 
Fictionality - looking for what's imposed or retained at the end of the story? Or more concerned with the awkwardnesses and difficulties within it?
Complication of the fictive - everything resolved by a stroke of magic rather than a behavioural relationship progression?
