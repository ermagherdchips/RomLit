# Romantic Fiction: *The Mysteries of Udolpho* (1794) and *The Wrongs of Woman* (1798)
*NOTE*: these notes aren't great. I don't feel particularly enthusiastic about it, so the notes may look a bit sparse. Soz.

## Reputations: the contrasting ways they were seen
* Polwhele (#1): Considering the nature and role of women in society 
    * Distinguishing between those that encouraged virtue and those threatening the social order
    * Radical writers warned away
    * Wollstonecraf tthe pale form - ghastly prescence, epitome of modesty and contagion other women are encouraged to avoid
* Virtuous women are national pride - assumption that women with French revolutionary ideas are bad for the nation
* Contrast in the two novels - 
    * Udolpho as a bestselling genre defining work
    * Wrongs was a fragment hidden from the time and brought back by feminists
    * But do have things in common
* Radcliffe was successful prior to Udolpho - recognised as exceptional, defining Gothic developments
    * Conformed to feminine modesty
    * 1796, dissapeared; death in 1823, #2 as a response of her modesty
    * #3 about her 
* In contrast, Wollstonecraft was more radical - first woman to act as a staff writer writing pieces on demand
    * Recognised the singularity of her occupation - first of a new genius
    * Travelled to France after the revolution and had a child without marriage; atetmpted suicide twice
    * Met William Godwin and had a relationship - child was Mary Shelley; died in complications of the birth
    * Godwin published the WoW as a posthumous work
* Polwhele saw her story as influenced by 'The Hand of Providence' - #4 is a footnote in WoW
    * Responses to the novel were condemning: #5
    * Her work fell into neglect; but Vindication made a profound impression on the public


## Vindication: Wollstonecraft
* Publication of this made her name; had earlier written on education, transition to political debate when she responded to Burke's Reflections on the Revolution of France
* Wollstonecraft opposed Burke's defence of the old regime - excluded all women
* Tapped into the contemporary zeitgeist 
* Bestseller - #6
* Argued for the importance of an education for women and their equal capacity for knowledge 
* Religious imperative: #7
* Saw women's defects as culturally constructed rather than due to an innate sexual character: #8
* Writing of women in the middle-classes - aristocratic women had an education, working-class women were too busy working to get one
* Wrote sternly in #9 - criticising romanticism
* Mary - a sentimental novel worth reading too - is also a novel of sentiment linking to these ideas
* Examines and deplores the disadvantages of sensibility - Wollstonecraft's work exhibits contradictions
* Influence of the Gothic between vindication and WoW: 'In Gothic, she finds the appropriate discursive form for her social critique of the rape of women's humanity' (E.J. Clery, p. 116)


## Udolpho: women aand the law, legal constraints of women
* The importance of sensibility as a marker of virtue is established from the outset
* Emily is undoubtedly a hero of sentiment - #10
* #11 - cultivating her knowledge
* Aubert is also full of sensibility evident in the sentimental novel - #12
* Aunt's unrestrained behaviour in contrast - not a sympathetic character
* Property as the motif for poor treatment - focuses on women's legal status within marriage 
    * Women lacking some ownership - not gone into in the novel, but not able to access
    * #13 shows that women often struggled to maintain their property even if they were legally entitled to it
* Heroism in the aunt - not a nice person, but brave and persevering #14
* Emily claims she is willing to resign her ownership - her virtue and sensibility comes out when she cares more about her aunt's wellbeing; but once dead, when she knows they are hers, it does not give them up - #15
* #16 - looking after her rights with dignity - no trembling sensibility
* Suffering like a heroine - #17
* Wavers from her resolution - #18
* #19 shows her resistence - image of valour
* #20 - insists that women can oppose - has a critique but cannot be carried through

## Radical gothic: use of the gothic and fictionalisation of her critique
* Makes the everyday gothic - 'reality is worse than fiction or, rather, for women reality is gothic' (Kilgour, quoted in Heiland, p. 97)
* #21 shows themes of horror
* #23 - Udolpho is a gothic structure; but this building can be compared to Burke's reflection on France - articulated an aesthetic that linked sublime emotions to obscurity, terror and self-preservation, helping to develop a language that could be used to describe the intentions and effects of Gothic literature and art
    * His reflections on the revolution were Gothic in ideology (worthy of being kept as feudal structures) and formally (style of disposition of rambling)
    * The key is not to dissolve the whole fabric, but to regenerate the parts that need it - #22?
* Repairs done in Wollstonecraft's novel are just crumbling and willing to be rebuilt rather than resotirng - contrast to Burke
* #24 - Burke's near gothicism - those who advocated radical reform were seen as promoting revolutionary ideas, and regarded sceptically and with fear
* Concerned with the legal disempowerment of women in marriage 
* #25 Maria is desperate to find a friend and receives some money
* Gothic terror as part of the legal system for women, not just a distant idea



*Sorry future me. These aren't great. I'm so tired hahahaha*
