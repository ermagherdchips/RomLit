# Wordsworth's Narrative and Lyric Poems
* Greatest poet of the English language since Shakespeare
* Paradox between a simple utterance and the expressiveness of battling troubles and affects of the time
* Continually testing the reader through 'the fluxes and refluxes of the mind'
* Ploddy narrating 
* Ode: Intimation of Immortality - monosyllables drag, grasping at the non-subjective but viewing it as subjective - simplicity of the work
* Eloquent bareness in the final line of the Elegiac Stanzas - idea that life is simple is misleading; stills the turmoil to show the ongoing reality of suffering; retains a residual sense of purpose in the final line; about the role of the poet
* PASSION in the odes: derived from the word suffering (Preface to 1850 Prelude)
* Note added to the Thorn: deficiencies of word as when we are stuck we stick to the same words (e.g. Lear, 'never never never') can become a strength: 'Words, a Poet's words more particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper. For the Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion: it is the history ro science of feelings: now every man must knwo that an attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers, or the deficiencies of language.' - to turn this into expressive possibilities in poetry

## The Ruined Cottage (narrative poem)
* Was left as a manuscript and incorporated in Book I of the Excursion 
* Characters do or say little about passion
* She becomes the tragic heroine
* Interpretive challenge - reading and misreading of signs 
* Emblem of mistakes - mroe unkempt as she ebcomes more unhappy 
* Peddler turns to the garden - shocked statement 'It was changed' - simple english word
* Making the reader recognise the uncertianty of the language
* Ominous undertone of change increases as the poem continues
* She has to find a language to articulate her suffering - detonating a charge associated with the word changed; she has a consciousness of this change and cannot do anything about it because of her obssessive heart wasting
* Revelation and concealment - we hear that suffering; silent torment has found a language - ordinary words have psychological implications; enjmabment allows the voice to fall; using gestures
* Spoken words make clear that despair does not torture her, but hope does - refuses to disbelieve
* Peddler tries to square tragic pity with acceptance - 'she sleeps in the calm earth and peace is here', no longer tormented by consciousness; her tormented consciousness has established this
* Poet of the gap between consciousness and nature - relationship between them, poetry of complexity
* Trance - sorrow and dispair offered as the meaning of the poem; need a balance of positivity to his intuition but the words are just a moment's instinct, not a philosophical truth - 'appeared' as a marker of unreliability

## Michael 
* Concluding poem of the second volumme of the Lyrical Ballads after deciding Christabel would not be included
* Force of his remark in the Preface - Lyrical (narrative elements) - 'it is proper that I should mention one other circumstance which distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the feeling.' - not for cheap thrills 
* Simple action or inaction is powerful in this poem - momentous action to do with inaction
* Shepherd - bond between father and son and remarkable action (wrote about a strong bond despite not having tthe bond himself - power of the imaignation)
* WW's interest is not with Luke, but with Michael (final section quote) 
* Comfort in the strength of love; heartbreakl alluded to
* Narrative at pains to assert all was as it was - repeating earlier lines word-for-word trnslates the reader to an earleir landscape but no longer has the companionship of his son - tragic stoicism
* 'never lifted up a single stone' - sense he is willing to progress, but unable to do so because of his grief; undertaking a personal observation but inner feelings cannot be mediated
* Writing of restraint - demands that the reader slows down
* 'great and simple affections of our nature' - aware when in presence of the powerful things in life, this is when language begins to crumple and he tries to raise to the task

## Song
* Enigmatic half-love half-elegy poems of Lucy
* Coleridge thought they were written in a sombre mood when imaigning the death of his sister Dorothy
* Her being is more important than her words - 'dwelt' slows the poem's rhythm and syntax down 
* Beauty becomes an image of both the violet and star - singleness, star gives ehr transcendent value
* Change in tone at the end as an elective charge from the 'Oh!'
* Sense of feeling from his sensitivity - 'being' and the value of being is important
* Rhyme of no and oh is ushering in a Romantic reaction against traditional forms of knowledge and the difference of knowledge formation
* Example of his lyricism

## Simon Lee
* How poetry can lead us in directions that let up guard - prompting us to look at the dignities of old age anew
* Bad poem - rhymes bounce off one another - but cleverly bringing out the difficulties and impossibilities of finding a language for this subject
* Transition occurs in the poem as 'Few months of life he has in store...'
* Turning to and on the poetry as readers are invited to become a poet
* Readers as gentlemen - in social class but also emotionally
* Deliberately slows down the poem to say that the story has to be thought about - patience required
* Ability to find a tale in everything if the imagination allows it - drawing a lesson that this in itself is beset with difficulties as he expresses at the end of the poem
* Tries to remove an oppresison, but the exploration of the human heart goes beyond oppression 
* Challenging the attack on gratitude as an irrational feeling - expressing the human condition
* Alerting us for the need for pity to someone and questions what happens when we experience pity 

## The Fountain (A Conversation)
* Articulating the gap between nature and consciousness - psychological penetration that love is easy to say but is intricate in reality if we misconstrue love 
* Feeling conveyed through gesture 'he grasped his hands' - confirming Matthew's isolation from the narrator
* Mixture of feeling

## Tintern Abbey
* Remarkable balance of joy and loss, recompense and loss
* Return to a particular place and a landscape around him he had previously visited, celebrating the powers of the serene
* Persuaded by a blank verse - language mirrors in its restraint 
* Types of ambiguity - anguish creating a seaprate sense of being and states are connected with one another in the poem
* Knitting up loss and recompense - sense sublime in feeling and intuition and deeply interfused 
* Ecological poetry
* Ends with a moving address top his sister - the kinship with her gives him comfort that they can withstand suffering; using Dorothy as a version of himself to some, but O'Neill views her as ahving her own existence here; sees a former self within her, but recognising her separateness and denying her otherness

## Immortality Ode
* Relating to his inability as a state of death as a state of feeling - an adult losing something as a child; realises that it was not just a love of nature that was important but 'obstinate questionings of sense' and misgivings - needing to convince himself he was in a physical world and a sense that he had a pre-existence of the soul
* Finishes first 4 stanzas on a note of loss but also of ercovery; then tries to answer them in the later 7 stanzas, which are written 2 years later
* Above all, what matters to him is the end - returns to a sense of authority and significance 
* recognising his individual response rather than sheer egotism - resonating and haunts with the final line 'Thoughts that do *often* lie too deep for tears'; benign profundity; the word deep is reclaimed at the end of the poem
