# Keats' reception
* Humble origins - son of a stableman
* His contemporary reviewers was not positive 
* Viewed as a social pariah - effeminite poetry, sensibilities not masculine enough, found very little to like in his poetry
* F.R. Leavis praises Keats for his ability 'to make concrete and lend solidity to the imaginative world' that his poetic worlds create
* The negative view of Keats persisted - W.B. Yeats saw Keats as 'When I think of him, I think of him with face and nose pressed to a sharp window... his heart unsatisfied... shut out from all the luxury of the world'
    * Idea that he is prevented from being in touch with the world because of his origins
* Despite the nature of his language and interests in sensation ('what shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the (?) poet') he thinks of other themes
* In touch with life - well-acquainted with early 19th century hospitals
* Suffering and the human condition at its worst was what he experienced at an early age
* Sense of the tragic human condition meshed with his writing of poetry - negative capability
* Odes about flights of imagination and flights of self-discovery - Matthew Arnold 'as a dialogue of the self with the self' or the mind with the mind

# Negative capability
* Coins himself relating to his brothers - aware of the qualities of Ailment in Shakespeare (King Lear) 
* Quote #1 - for Keats, the poetic character has no self - in essence, the poetical self is empty and without a sense of subjectivity
* Thinks of the poet as possessing an imaginative empathy, the ability to identify strongly with the object/subject used to describe
* The poetic self is echoed out into the existence of the object/subject it describes
* In the Odes, imaginative flights lead Keats to come back to an altered self from the journey
* Ability to allow all disagreeables to evaporate - to be 'in a mist' (in another letter)
* Poet's ability to inhabit all states of being
* Division between observing subject and observed subject become emphasised in Quote #2 

# Ode to Psyche
* Earliest spring Ode - difficulty in being precise of the ordering of the odes, but we see them as from Psyche to Insolence(?) to Grecian Urn, Nightingale, and finally with To Autumn
* Opening lines (Quote #3) - this Ode is Keats' hymn to the imagination, placing out contradictions
    * Keatsian expectation and the intensity of art and what the imagination can achieve
    * Utterance and appeal almost stifled out at the beginning before the chance to be spoken
    * Central concern of the Psyche - demi-goddess who has not been celebrated as much in her own day 
    * The speaker wants to address the imbalance to her and renew praise for her - putting on a pedastal with other deities
    * Difficulties to do this - behind this aspiration to elevate Psyche's status, concern with the poet's figure and himself as a relatively new emergent voice who has yet not been recognised or achieving the status he aspires
    * Addressing the imbalance for Psyche with an awareness of addressing the imbalance in his own poetic career
    * Hovers between dream and reality - uncertain of the level we have been imagining
* Quote #4: Blurring the boundaries between the physical world and the interior world of thought
    * Links to Satan's temptation of Eve - creating a kind of fiction to blur the boundary between the real and the dream 
    * In fiction-making, there is the potential for deceitfulness
    * Sense that this accidental stumbling upon the Psyche should not have taken place?
* These anxieties about poetic aspiration become more to the fore later in the poem - describes the dilemma of Psyche in Quote #5
    * Risk that she will fade into obscurity before she is recognised 
* The Ode makes good on this blurring - closes in an entirely interior scene - landscape becomes mental and the product of the working brain
    * No longer a place where one wonders thoughtlessly, but is an architecture 
    * Gentle switch from what might be a confusion to a definite creation of an interior space where Psyche can be praised and where poet can dedicate himself without doubt as the priest of Psyche's glory
    * Often ends his odes on a mode of uncertainty and threshold point - awareness of a world of darkness beyond the casement
    * Self-consciousness and sense that it knows it is at its limit as an Ode 
* Typical of the Odes that Keats seeks to appropriate history and mythology - weaving them into a tapestry of his imagination

# Ode to a Grecian Urn
* World of antiquity represented to us as an artefact, presented in the course of the ode as an object that Keats observes in the museum space of the poem
* The Urn is resistant to the speaker - the speaker is insistent on receiving answers from the urn
* Ability for eloquence in the Urn recognised by the speaker, yet the Urn also seems to refuse to speak to Keats' observer 
    * Element of frustration of the second part of the first stanza - questions clustered together (Quote #9)
    * The Urn is curiously viewed as female - the speaker's cascading of questions as a verbal assault on the urn to elicit some wisdom and she refuses to provide it
* Has to resort to a different strategy from these questions - pictures hiself looking out at the thing the urn depicts - he sees the depiction of the lovers caught in a static oment for all eternity
* The Urn offers us a retreat from our mutable world of change
* The looking and recognising of the urn as a sterile but immutable object returns us to our own world - Quote #10
    * False note struck, criticality of the urn?
    * Moving out towards the attraction that the urn offers, to bring him back to himself and our world - recognising human passion
    * Moving beyond the point that the lovers are always in anticipation of but never able to achieve
* Urn changes as the poem continues - nature of the scene is less certain as depicted
    * Viewed as deserted on the Urn - seems to be that as the poem progresses and gets to this stage, the urn is more than an imaginative construct for Keats
    * People were unable to find Keats' Urn - verbal construct and because it cannot speak to Keats' observer-poet, he becomes more speculative and acknowledges that this urn is not an actual artefact but a composite urn
    * May be linked to Elgin Marbles
* Speculation true of the Urn's final stanza - thinks of the world of human passion as denounced as 'Cold Pastoral!'
    * Recognising limitations of 'breeds of marble men'
    * Keats wanting to denounce the urn for being 'overwrought' (perhaps as an imaginative object, it has been overly donned)
    * Also a self-reflective moment - Keats as a poet and a sculptor, judging the work he has rendered as too much overly done and hence his denouncement as cold pastoral
    * It is an Urn, and while a historical artefact it once had a ritualistic role in society and held ashes of the dead - the urn may be pointing back to the world of transcience and mutability (our world and our place) - not so abstract/transcendental it says nothing of our condition 

*Had a short break there to look at my feedback for an essay, sorry if I'm missing helpful things*

* In the end, the poem wants us to view art as something born from suffering

# Ode to a Nightingale
* The Nightingale's song is the most important thing - something to which Keats can't feel anything else
* The lack of sensation and the inability to feel coming on to such an extent that the lack of feeling becomes a positive sensation itself
* The Nightingale's song is melodious and unpremeditated/un-selfconscious and is what the speaker aspires - wants a song like the Nightingale's own - beyond pain and loss
* Works through a series of Keats' speaker imagining how he could attain this state - contemplates a variety of options
* Through an intoxication, he can achieve a lack of self-consciousness - aspiration to be at one with the nightingale's song
* As he moves out with these thoughts, he is brought back to the limitations of our own world - thoughts of the transcience of human existence - series of strofes and anti-strofes characterising the odes
* 10 line stanzas, Shakespearean quatrain and Petrachan sestet - outward movement and return back to awareness of circumstances
* Playing with literary tropes - nightingale links to the tragedy of Philomela; not explicit, but sublimated
* Wants to question and undo its own gowns for being - starts in an unspecified location
* Anxiety about silence and poetic figure - inviting but troubling 'purple stained-mouth' - troubling and disturbing image of Philomela into the imagery of the ode and cast as the biblical figure of Ruth made more explicit in Quote #7
* Encountering these things that the ode turns us towards positively - these anxieties about an ultimate silence that can culminate in death - time having a devastating effect on human life

# To Autumn
* Thinking about the limitations of existence and the conversations for our lives 
* Lives in a perfect balance between living and dying - talks in later stanzas about 'light wind lives or dies' (Quote #12)
* Sets into motion a series of different processes that never end up reaching their end - everything is set in motion, but nothing ends
* Quote #13 - figure of autumn as a reaper 
* Moving their way out of the poem but not finished the process of dying
* 'Full grown lamb' rather than sheep - sense of process but not yet reaching their final state 
* What happened to time - aware it is the day, movement through a single day and through all of the seasons (it is an autumn that has gone on so long that it merges with the rest) - telescoped into a single day
* There seems to be less of a debate with the self and a dialogue with the mind - Keats evolved his stanzaic structure to be 11 lines
* Responding to the figure of Autumn 'herself' - suggested feminine figure but was viewed as a male figure in Keats' time
    * Links to images of maternity and feminity at the start
    * There is a reimagined and softened down version of the Grim Reaper 
    * Enmeshing of the human consciousness in the natural world as part of an understanding that humans belong in this natural process - perfectly ordinary and part of nature's design process that all will end

Keats' poetry, like the negatively capable self, is concerned with its own existence - a test out there for itself, about mourning past possible states of being, but also celebrating the possible future states of being an imagination can inhabit
