# Definitions, Themes, and the Visual Arts (Dr Sarah Wootton)
* Three hour exam; three questions; four authors
* Writers would explore aesthetic concerns through essays (e.g. Shelley's Defense on Poetry; Preface to the Lyrical Ballads

## The influence of Romanticism
* Romantic literature viewed as quintessential English literature - a by-word for creativity and inspiration
* Byronic traditions - development of a persona that becomes impossible to extricate the personal from the public
* Adaptations of the works and the universe

## Context 
* Romantic Period begins in 1789 at the start of the French Revolution, but there are obvious origins of Romanticism prior to this with Blake's poetical sketches in 1783 
* Considered to be mid/late 1870s-1825, with a blur in the period between this and Victoria's reign in 1837
* Period of intense activity in the arts - radical altering perceptions and attitudes about literature and the role of the writer/artist figure
* Transition from Enlightenment to modern industrialism - conflict and stress 
* Rumours of and a climate of war 
* Economic cycles of boom and depreession
* Revolution characterises the period - historical epoch
* Initial phase of optimism from 1789, then a reign of terror from 1793 - enthusing over the prospect of revolution
* Domestic revolution at home with industry - move from hand-labour to machinery and advances in science and technology resulted in excitement and anxiety 
* New prospects of literature - women writers, new readership

## Concepts of romanticism
* There is no self-styled romantic movement in Britain, so most Romantic writers would have found the term disparaging - it was primarily used by Victorians to distinguish themselves from this
* The very lack of a definition of Romanticism allows critical thought about the construct of Romanticism and approaches we can take to it
* 'The problem is that any such attempts to summarise Romanticism inevitably end up over-systematising and simplifying the phenomenon' (Aidan Day)
* 'the prevailing attitude favoured innnovation against traditionalism' (M.H. Abrams)
* 'Storm and stress' of the period 
* Nature and the landscape is an important theme - treated differently but a persistent preoccupation
* Importance of feelings and emotion - 'For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings' (Wordsworth) - poetry should not be forced or contrived 
* Subjectivity and the imagination: 'that which is romantic depicts emotional matter in an imaginative form' (Schlegel) - importance of individual vision
* Self-examination and self-consciousness in a period of growth and change
* New Historicism and Cultural Materialism increased thoughts on how writers were in dialogue with the writings at the time - Keats removed from reality was rethought of in the context of the politics and his medical training 
* Authors wanting to contemplate desires and the imagination - the mind/psyche as something interesting in the romantic period, with articulable depths in Kubla Khan 
* Gothic themes of understanding the self and entrapment in our consciousness
* Uncertainty leads to a maelstrom of creative forces and inspiration: 'Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world' (Shelley, A Defense of Poetry)
* Romanticism as a dialectic - breaking away from traditions to encompass a new aesthetic ('Without Contraries there is no progression', Marriage of Heaven and Hell)

## Conclusions
* Richness of creativity and revolution
